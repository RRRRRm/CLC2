# CLC2
## Calculus-ator, reimagined.

Symbolab is great, and so is Wolfram Alpha and all of those web calculators that let you do all your higher math. But wouldn't it be nice if an offline version existed? Here enters CLC2, the next evolution of (you guessed it) CLC (or autofoiler for those of you who used it way back). 

# Donations
I am a busy student, so I of all people understand the use case for an application like this. Compared to what you pay for Symbolab, a small donation of any size would help me out a ton and still be cheaper! Any donation a dollar or more will grant you the supporter rank on my Discord, which is for people who are interested in anything Animal Crossing, Pokemon, or Homebrew related, and get access to early versions of any open-source projects I am working on! **Remember**, people like you are the reason new features and maintanence will occur! Thank you!
