# CLC2
## Calculus-ator, reimagined.

Symbolab is great, and so is Wolfram Alpha and all of those web calculators that let you do all your higher math. But wouldn't it be nice if an offline version existed? Here enters CLC2, the next evolution of (you guessed it) CLC (or autofoiler for those of you who used it way back). *I understand that Symbolab will almost always be better, but that's not the point, we should all work together to make the best free, opensource offline version!*

## Future Improvements!
- [ ] Matrices
- [x] Definite Integrals (with multiple variables)
- [ ] Gradients
- [ ] **Graph Mode** (High priority, next feature)
- [ ] **Step-By-Step** (Also high priority, just a lot more work is needed)
Suggest things that should be added!

## Donations
I am a busy student, so I of all people understand the use case for an application like this. Compared to what you pay for Symbolab, a small donation of any size would help me out a ton and still be cheaper! Any donation a dollar or more will grant you the supporter rank on my Discord, which is for people who are interested in anything Animal Crossing, Pokemon, or Homebrew related, and get access to early versions of any open-source projects I am working on! **Remember**, people like you are the reason new features and maintanence will occur! Thank you!
